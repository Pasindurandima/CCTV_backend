-- PROFIT CALCULATION FIX INSTRUCTIONS
-- ======================================
-- The system now correctly calculates profit using:
-- Profit = (Selling Price - Cost Price) × Quantity
--
-- Cost Price Priority:
-- 1. If product has 'cost_price' field set, it will use that
-- 2. If not, it will use 'original_price' field as the cost price
-- 3. If neither exists, it assumes 40% profit margin
--
-- EXAMPLE:
-- Product: DVR
-- - Original Price (Cost): Rs 15,000
-- - Price (Selling): Rs 20,000
-- - Quantity: 1
-- - Calculated Profit: Rs 5,000 (20,000 - 15,000)
--
-- NOTE: When adding products in Admin Panel:
-- - "Original Price" field = Your COST PRICE (what you paid for the product)
-- - "Price" field = Your SELLING PRICE (what customer pays)
--
-- No database changes needed - the backend code now automatically
-- uses original_price as cost price if cost_price is not set.
